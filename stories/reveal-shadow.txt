“Show yourself!” You pull your sword out.

There was a pause. Your hands start to tremble.

“I don’t fear you! Come out right now!” you say, hoping your voice doesn't betray fear.

You hear a sudden WHOOSH and you see a cloaked figure emerging from the trees, flying directly towards you. You raise your sword higher and take a swing at it. He dodges and flies to your right, almost hitting you across the face with his own sword. You fall straight to the ground from dodging it. Now you’re even more determined to defeat this cloaked figure. He lands on his feet. You look up at his taut, patched up face. He has with empty sockets where his eyes are supposed to be. He nudges for you to get up and fight.

"Fine. You want a fight? Let’s fight!" 

You and the now unmasked figure (flying dead man? spirit?) start battling. With a clash of swords, you and he engage in a dance of sorts, a dance for life, a dance of death. You twist, dodge, and attack with all the might that years of training has given you. He’s good, you can admit. But you’re better. This is what you’re good at. This is what makes you feel alive. 

Finally, you get to his blind spot and attack him straight into his chest. His eyes, despite its empty sockets, get wide when he realizes in that split second that he lost. He blows up in smithereens.

Panting slightly, you stare into empty space where the man was standing mere moments ago. Life around went back as if nothing out of the ordinary happened. As if it was inconsequential whether you win or not. 

Shaking your head, you continue walking, still with your sword raised. Just in case.

You pass a clearing but still continue along the path ahead of you. After walking for about an hour, you come across a small hut. There was light inside. But before you even put one more step forward, a man with the strangest clothes appear before you. He’s wearing a robe, a pointed hat, and holding up wand up at you.

Do you run away or face the wizard?
