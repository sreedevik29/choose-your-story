You accept her hands. Her lovely, beautiful, bejeweled hands. The singing is all you hear. You smile and step further in. This is where you meant to be. You certainly feel fulfilled. 

But a quickly as you think this thought, the singing turns into shrieking, the hands into claws, digging into your skin, and the lovely face into a hideous beast growling at you menacingly. You try to escape it. The water crashes into your body, bringing you further down. You hold your breath while trying to fight those hideous claws, desperately trying to reach for your sword. But it’s not use. You struggle to hold your breath but unintentionally lets it go. The water starts filling your lungs and you start descending into the water, and you lose consciousness. The last thing you see is a woman with claws, red eyes, and large fangs snarling at you.

You die without ever finding fulfillment, a trapped soul in the clutches of a beast.
