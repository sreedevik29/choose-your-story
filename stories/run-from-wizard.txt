Duh! You run as fast as you can! After that monster, you’re not taking any chances.

“Get back here you whippersnapping trespasser!” 

You look back and you see he seems to have been vanished! You take your sword out and keep running then BAM! You run right into him. Gathering your wits, you slash your sword at him. 

The wizard’s face twists in fury and takes his wand out. You hear him cry out a spell. All you see is white light and then blank.

You die before you even realize you’ve been hit.
